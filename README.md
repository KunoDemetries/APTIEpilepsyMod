# APTIEpilepsyMod
A mod to remove flashing lights from A Plague Tale: Innocence

# General Usage
The mod itself injects DLLs into the game that will then visually show you it's enabled. Once the DLL is injected, the injector may be closed to save memory space.

# general Controls
For simplicity there are only 4 controls, selecting the launcher (Steam or Epic), the injection button, F1 for tooltips on how to play ATPI in fullscreen with the mod, and Cntrl+F12 to inject while tabbed away from the injector itself.
